Okay so this is the data we can get from NOAA, let's delete the ones we're not interested in.

**** EMXP - Extreme maximum daily precipitation
**** MMNT - Monthly Mean minimum temperature (i.e. average low temp)
HX3299 - Highest maximum soil temperature for the month (degrees F)(cover: bare ground
**** EMXT - Extreme maximum daily temperature (i.e. the hottest it got in the time period?)
MMNP - Monthly mean minimum temperature of evaporation pan water.
**** DT90 - Number days with maximum temperature greater than or equal 90.0 F
*** DP10 - Number of days with greater than or equal to 1.0 inch of precipitation
TEVP - Total monthly evaporation.
**** TPCP - Total precipitation
**** EMNT - Extreme minimum daily temperature (i.e. the coldest it got in the time period?)
*** DT32 - Number days with minimum temperature less than or equal to 32.0 F
*** DX32 - Number days with maximum temperature less than or equal to 32.0 F
**** MXSD - Maximum snow depth
*TWND - Total monthly wind movement (in miles) over evaporation pan.
LX3299 - Lowest maximum soil temperature for the month (degrees F)(cover: bare ground
* HTDD - Heating degree days
Heating degree day (HDD) is a measurement designed to reflect the demand for energy needed to heat a building. It is derived from measurements of outside air temperature. The heating requirements for a given structure at a specific location are considered to be directly proportional to the number of HDD at that location. A similar measurement, cooling degree day (CDD), reflects the amount of energy used to cool a home or business.

**** DP01 - Number of days with greater than or equal to 0.1 inch of precipitation
**** DPNP - Departure from normal monthly precipitation.
**** TSNW - Total snow fall
**** DT00 - Number days with minimum temperature less than or equal to 0.0 F
** DP05 - Number of days with greater than or equal to 0.5 inch of precipitation
**** DPNT - Departure from normal monthly temperature.
* CLDD - Cooling degree days
**** DSNW - Number days with snow depth > 1 inch.
**** MMXT - Monthly Mean maximum temperature
MMXP - Monthly mean maximum temperature of evaporation pan water.
**** MNTM - Monthly mean temperature
MX3299 - Monthly mean maximum soil temperature (degrees F)(cover: bare ground
